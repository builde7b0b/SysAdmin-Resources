############## SERVER ADMINISTRATION TOOLS ############

# 1. TightVNC

TightVNC is a remote desktop software application and it can be used to connect to another computer and display its live remote desktop. 

Like other VNC systems, it consists of two parts: the “Server”, which shares the screen of the machine it’s running on, and the “Viewer”, which shows the remote screen received from the server

# TightVNC Server is designed to run in two modes:
>> Application mode
>> Service mode

In application mode, the server, just like any other desktop software, can be running only during the current user session and quits on the logout. 
Each user has his/her personal settings and passwords.


# To start TightVNC Server in the application mode, choose:

Start->Programs->TightVNC->TightVNC Server (Application Mode)->Run TightVNC Server.

Service mode is configured independently of application mode. The settings and passwords of TightVNC Server as a service are global for all users.

To Run TightVNC Server in Service Mode:

* If you unchecked the recommended option “Register TightVNC Server as a system service” during installation, first, you need to register TightVNC Server as a service. Start->Programs->TightVNC->TightVNC Server (Service Mode)->Register TightVNC Service.

* To start TightVNC Server as a service, click:
Start->Programs->TightVNC->TightVNC Server (Service Mode)->Start TightVNC Service

## 2. NoMachine NX Client

NX is a desktop virtualization system that allows you to access Linux applications that are running on a server from a remote client device such as a PC, laptop or thin client. 
NX is similar to VNC in principle, but unlike VNC the NX server takes care of session management, and performance is usually better than VNC over a low bandwidth connection.

When you have finished working you can disconnect from your remote desktop session instead of logging out, simply by closing the NX desktop window on you host computer’s desktop (e.g. your thin client or Windows PC). 
NX will ask you if you want to “Disconnect” or “Terminate” the session.

Choose “Disconnect” leave all your programs running on the server, or “Terminate” if you want to log out completely and close all running programs. 
If you disconnect you will be able to reconnect to your desktop session later, possibly on another computer in another location, where you will find all your applications and network connections still running as you left them.

NX Client is a cross-platform application, available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, It has strong security by running the network traffic through an encrypted ssh network connection and the connection feels fast because compression and caching of data reduces the amount and size of X11 packets sent over the network.

## 3.Remmina

Remmina is a remote desktop software client for Linux-based computer operating systems. 
It supports the RDP, VNC, NX,XDMCP and SSH protocols. 
Remmina offers support for a multitude of remote access protocols. 
This GTK based application also has the slickest support for SSH, because it’s built very tightly, right into the application.

Its a pure GTK+ 2.0 application which maintains a list of connection profiles, organized by groups and make quick connections by directly putting in the server address.Remote desktops with higher resolutions are scrollable/scalable in both window and fullscreen mode ( Viewport fullscreen mode: remote desktop automatically scrolls when the mouse moves over the screen edge.)

The floating toolbar in fullscreen mode, allows you to switch between modes, toggle keyboard grabbing, minimize, etc. 
Provides tabbed interface, optionally managed by groups and also a Tray icon, allows you to quickly access configured connection profiles. 
A tabbed user interface is handy for keeping track of everything.

It also offers a smart tray icon, which makes switching from one connection to another a simple endeavor and provides smooth controls for SSH integration. 
Just select VNC, then tab over to SSH and setup accordingly. 
It offers a floating toolbar when in full screen which is useful when you’re working with limited screen real estate.

Remmina plugins are RDP, VNC, NX, XDMCP, SSH, Telepathy

## 6. RealVNC

RealVNC is server and client application for the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocol to control another computer’s screen remotely. 
For a desktop-to-desktop connection RealVNC runs on Windows, on Mac OS, and on many Unix-like operating systems. 
Stable release of RealVNC is 5.2.1

RealVNC comes in one of three editions: Open edition, Personal edition, Enterprise Edition..
RealVNC clients using vncviewer can run in full-screen mode; 
they use the F8 function-key as the default key for bringing up an options menu.

The server component of RealVNC allows a computer to be remotely controlled by another computer. 
The software can be installed for legitimate purposes, but it can also be installed from a remote location by an attacker with malicious intent.

The limitations of Realvnc: The VNC protocol is pixel based. 
Although this leads to great flexibility, it is often less efficient than solutions that have a better understanding of the underlying graphic layout, like X11.

- These are back screen window which helps to login to the console of a linux machine through SSH.

# All the Terminal tools are used to perform the following actions:
→ Access a UNIX shell environment.
→ Run any application that is designed to run on VT102, VT220, and xterm terminals.

-All terminal application also provide the feature to use multiple terminals in a single window (tabs) and profiles support.
-With the help of creating profiles we can customize the appearance and font of the terminals.


# Different type of Terminals are available in different Linux OS such as :

# 1. Gnome-Terminal : Gnome Terminal is a part of GNOME Project. 
- This terminal is written in C Language. 
- More than one tabs are possible for the gnome-terminal and we can switch from one to another with custom keyboard shortcuts.

# 2. Konsole : Konsole is a terminal emulator for the K Desktop Environment.

- All instances of program share the same process to reduce memory usage. 
- It also has the common features of all other terminals such as Color scheme,scrolling option etc

# 4. XTerm : It is the standard terminal emulator for the X Window System. 
- xterm added a few protocols that have been adapted by other terminal emulators, such as xterm mouse tracking and the xterm 256 colors protocol later.

# 5. UXTerm : UXTerm act has an wrapper around the xterm. 
- All the arguements to UXTerms are passed directly to Xterm without processing.
- The locale settting is very important for UXTerm for its proper working. 
- It may produce unexpected results if the current locale is set to one in which the UTF-8 character encoding is not supported or if fonts using the ISO 10646-1 character set are not available.
